- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive layouts for portrait and landscape orientations
- **Interactive UI**: Modern Material 3 design with intuitive input fields
- **Navigation System**: Seamless flow from calculation to purchase confirmation
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant payment calculations with user input changes
- **Purchase Simulation**: Complete checkout flow with confirmation screen

## ✨ Key Features
- 💰 **Smart Calculations**: Input loan amount, down payment, interest rate, and term length
- 📱 **Dual Orientation Support**: Optimized layouts for both portrait and landscape modes
- 🎛️ **Radio Button Selection**: Easy loan term selection (24, 36, 48, 60 months)
- 🧮 **Instant Results**: Real-time monthly payment display with proper formatting
- 🛒 **Mock Checkout**: Simulated purchase experience with confirmation screen
- 🎨 **Material 3 UI**: Clean, modern interface following Google's design guidelines
- 🔄 **State Management**: Persistent data across screen rotations and navigation
